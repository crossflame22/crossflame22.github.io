        <h3>This Website</h3>
        <p>I'm going to try to always be working on this website, as I improve at programming.</p>
        <h3>Gamer Code (might change title)</h3>
        <p>This is a program a friend wrote with a bit of my help, that I'm going to try to rewrite in order to add more support for users outside our school.</p>
